# README

**This is very much a work-in-progress.  Suggestions and tips are quite welcome.**

This is an attempt to translate the front end of the wonderful [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/) to use  the amazing isomorphic framework tools provided by [Hyperloop](http://ruby-hyperloop.io) (formerly reactrb).  Specifically we will make use of the HyperMesh and HyperRails tools.  Rails will still be the back end.  I have used Devise for managing users, but in the future may modify this to roll its own user management system.  I will also extend the original Rails Tutorial sample app by adding a Private Messaging feature as well as a real-time chat feature.
